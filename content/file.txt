We create a promise using the new Promise() constructor. Inside the constructor, there's an asynchronous operation simulated with setTimeout. Depending on a randomly generated number, the promise is either resolved with a success message or rejected with an error message.

We use the .then() method to specify what should happen when the promise is resolved. In this case, we log the success message to the console.

We use the .catch() method to specify what should happen when the promise is rejected. In this case, we log the error message to the console.

Promises allow you to write asynchronous code in a more sequential and readable way. They also make it easier to handle errors and ensure that your code is more maintainable when dealing with asynchronous operations.

In modern JavaScript, you can also use async/await syntax, which builds on promises and provides a more synchronous-looking way to work with asynchronous code.
